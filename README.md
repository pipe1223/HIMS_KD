## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of **Hierarchical Multi-Segment Knowledge Distillation (HIMS_KD)**, a novel methodology designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge transfer in remote sensing applications. The framework employs a multi-stage distillation process to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, enabling the student to capture a more nuanced understanding of the teacher's knowledge.
